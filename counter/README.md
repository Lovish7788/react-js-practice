# Counter Project 🔢

In this project, I practiced the core fundamentals of React state management.

## Concepts Learned:
* **useState Hook:** Used to track the counter value and update the UI dynamically.
* **Event Handling:** Implementing `onClick` functions for increment and decrement buttons.
* **Component Structure:** Breaking the UI into reusable React components.

## Files:
* `App.jsx`: Main logic for the counter.
* `Practice2.jsx`: Experimental file for testing component re-renders.

* `Practice3.jsx`: in this i learned how to use conditional statement inside jsx element

*`Practice4.jsx`: in this we learn how to use array and maps to create each button and change background color using those button if we were in vanilla js we have to create multiple buttons and add multiple event listners
