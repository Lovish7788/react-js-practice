# Counter Project 🔢

In this project, I practiced the core fundamentals of React state management.

## Concepts Learned:
* **useState Hook:** Used to track the counter value and update the UI dynamically.
* **Event Handling:** Implementing `onClick` functions for increment and decrement buttons.
* **Component Structure:** Breaking the UI into reusable React components.

## Files:
* `App.jsx`: Main logic for the counter.
* `Practice2.jsx`: Experimental file for testing component re-renders.
